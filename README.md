# job-activate-power

# Power Outage and Reactivate Plugin - for Athena Framework

If this Plugin is active, the City Power will be Offline. It can be Turned on by a Player.
After the Power is Back online, the Job cant be done again (Why do you want to Repair something, when its already Working :D)

Have Fun
